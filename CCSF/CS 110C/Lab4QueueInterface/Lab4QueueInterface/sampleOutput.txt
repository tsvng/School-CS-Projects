Arithmetic expressions.  The operators *, /, and % have the same precedence,(1) which is higher than that of + and -; unary operators have a higher precedence than binary operators.(2)

File extensions.  By convention, the name of a header file associated with a user defined library ends in .h.(3)  Typically, the name of an implementation file ends in .cpp.(4)

Endnotes:

1) A list of all C++ operators and their precedences appears inside the back cover of this book.

2) A unary operator requires only one operand, for example, the - in -5.  A binary operator requires two operands, for example, the + in 2 + 3.

3) Other conventions, such as .hpp or .hxx, exist.

4) Other conventions, such as .C, .cp, or .cxx, exist.

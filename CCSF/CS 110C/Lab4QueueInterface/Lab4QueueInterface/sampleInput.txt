Arithmetic expressions.  The operators *, /, and % have the same precedence,{A list of all C++ operators and their precedences appears inside the back cover of this book.} which is higher than that of + and -; unary operators have a higher precedence than binary operators.{A unary operator requires only one operand, for example, the - in -5.  A binary operator requires two operands, for example, the + in 2 + 3.}

File extensions.  By convention, the name of a header file associated with a user defined library ends in .h.{Other conventions, such as .hpp or .hxx, exist.}  Typically, the name of an implementation file ends in .cpp.{Other conventions, such as .C, .cp, or .cxx, exist.}

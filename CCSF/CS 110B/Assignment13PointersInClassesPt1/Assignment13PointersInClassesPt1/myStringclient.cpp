/*
* These functions are designed to help you test your myString objects,
* as well as show the client usage of the class.
*
* The BasicTest function builds an array of strings using various
* constructor options and prints them out.  It also uses the String
* stream operations to read some strings from a data file.
*
* The RelationTest function checks out the basic relational operations
* (==, !=, <, etc) on Strings and char *s.
*
*
* The CopyTest tries out the copy constructor and assignment operators
* to make sure they do a true deep copy.
*
* Although not exhaustive, these tests will help you to exercise the basic
* functionality of the class and show you how a client might use it.
*
* While you are developing your myString class, you might find it
* easier to comment out functions you are ready for, so that you don't
* get lots of compile/link complaints.
